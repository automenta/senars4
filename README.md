# **SeNARS Cognitive System**
Unified, Grounded, Evolving Cognitive Architecture

---

## **1. Core Principles**

### **1.1 Experience-Grounded Reasoning**
All knowledge originates from observed inputs or derived inferences. No hard-coded axioms. Beliefs evolve via evidence accumulation using **NARS-style truth revision**.

### **1.2 Uncertainty-Aware Computation**
Every assertion carries a **truth value** (`frequency`, `confidence`). Every goal carries an **attention value** (`priority`, `durability`). All cognitive processes operate on these values.

### **1.3 Goal-Directed Cognition**
Cognitive processes are driven by active goals. The system prioritizes tasks based on a learned model of **utility Ã— attention / cost**, ensuring goal relevance guides resource allocation.

### **1.4 Resource-Aware Operation**
All operations are tracked and bounded by CPU time, memory footprint, and I/O bandwidth. Resource estimates are dynamically calibrated and used for scheduling.

### **1.5 Self-Reflective Evolution**
The system continuously monitors its performance and autonomously improves its schemas, beliefs, and operational parameters via a closed-loop self-reflection cycle, governed by a core safety constitution.

## **2. Unified Cognitive Entity (UCE)**

The single canonical data structure for all cognitive content, designed for multi-modal information.

```pseudocode
enum Content:
    Text(string)
    Numeric(float)
    Categorical(string, allowed_values: [string])
    Tensor(shape: [int], dtype: string, data: blob)
    Code(language: string, source: string)

struct UCE:
    id: UUID
    content: Content          // Typed content for multi-modal data
    embedding: [float; 384]?  // Generalized feature vector

    # Truth values (for beliefs)
    truth: {f: float, c: float}?

    # Attention values (for goals/tasks)
    attention: {p: float, d: float}?

    # Metadata
    meta: {
        type: "BELIEF" | "GOAL" | "QUERY" | "ACTION" | "SCHEMA" | "WORKFLOW" | "CONFIG" | "OBJECT_INSTANCE",
        domain: string,
        source: UUID?,
        timestamp: float,        // Creation time (Unix ms)
        last_accessed: float     // For LRU-based pruning
    }

    # Conflict & grounding
    conflicts: [UUID]?
    grounding: {
        llm_confidence: float?,
        nars_coherence: float?
    }?

    # Methods
    def evolve(truth_delta?, attention_delta?) -> UCE:
        # Updates truth/attention with NARS-style revision rules.
        # Returns new UCE with updated fields.

    def serialize_for_llm() -> string:
        # Converts any content type to a textual description for LLM processing.
        match self.content:
            case Text(s): return s
            case Tensor(shape, ...): return f"Tensor data of shape {shape} representing a feature map."
            case Code(lang, c): return f"A code snippet in {lang}."
            // etc.
```

## **3. World Model**

A persistent, indexed hypergraph knowledge base designed for scalable, real-time operation.

```pseudocode
class WorldModel:
    graph: Hypergraph<UCE>      // Nodes = UCEs, Edges = links. Backed by RocksDB or similar.

    indices: {
        semantic: VectorDB<UCE>,    // FAISS/Chroma for embedding-based search.
        temporal: BTree<UCE>,       // Keyed by timestamp.
        causal: DAG<UCE>,           // Directed acyclic graph of cause-effect links.
        lru: BTree<UCE>             // Keyed by last_accessed timestamp.
    }

    # Core Operations
    def add(uce: UCE) -> UUID:
        # Inserts UCE, updates all indices.
        id = assign_uuid()
        // ... database insertion and index updates ...
        # Triggers local, asynchronous maintenance.
        async_task_queue.submit(trigger_local_resonance_check, uce.id, k=10)
        return id

    def get(id: UUID) -> UCE?:
        # Retrieves UCE by ID.

    def query(pattern: UCEPattern, options: {...}) -> [UCE]:
        # Multi-index query using semantic, structural, and temporal filters.

    def remove(id: UUID) -> bool:
        # Removes UCE and all references. Returns false if protected.

    def link(a: UUID, b: UUID, relation: string) -> bool:
        # Adds hyperedge between UCEs.

    # Scalable Self-Maintenance
    def trigger_local_resonance_check(center_uce_id: UUID, k: int):
        # Event-driven coherence check on new data, avoids global scans.
        center_uce = self.get(center_uce_id)
        neighbors = self.indices.semantic.find_nearest(center_uce.embedding, k)
        cluster = [center_uce] + neighbors
        if calculate_coherence(cluster) > 0.8:
            for u in cluster:
                u.evolve(truth_delta={c: u.truth.c * 0.1}) # Boost confidence by 10%
                self.update(u)

    def background_prune_task():
        # Low-priority background thread for continuous cleanup.
        # Scans only a small fraction of least-recently-used items.
        candidates = self.indices.lru.get_range(max_ts=now() - 30_days, limit=1000)
        for uce in candidates:
            if uce.truth.c < 0.1 and uce.attention.d < 0.3 and not self.graph.has_links(uce.id):
                self.remove(uce.id)
```

        for workflow in self.queue:
            features = self.extract_features(workflow, active_goals)
            cost = self.cost_estimator.predict(features)
            utility = self.utility_predictor.predict(features)
            attention = max(world_model.get(i).attention.p for i in workflow.inputs)
            workflow.priority = (attention * utility) / (cost + 0.01)

    def learn_from_completed(workflow: Workflow):
        # Online learning to improve predictions.
        if workflow.status == "COMPLETE" and workflow.observed_resources:
            features = self.extract_features(workflow)
            self.cost_estimator.train(features, workflow.observed_resources.cpu)
            utility_label = 1.0 if workflow.goals_satisfied else 0.0
            self.utility_predictor.train(features, utility_label)

    def select_next() -> Workflow?:
        load = self.monitor.get_load()
        if load < 0.8:
            return self.queue.pop_highest()

        UCE(content="Modifications must not violate constitutional principles.", meta={type:"CONSTRAINT"})
    ]

    def check_compliance(proposed_change: UCE) -> bool:
        # Uses symbolic and semantic checks to ensure a change does not violate principles.
        for principle in self.principles:
            if violates(proposed_change, principle):
                return False
        return True

def validate_change(proposed_change: UCE) -> bool:

    if not constitution.check_compliance(proposed_change):
        return False

    # 2. Tiered Permission System

> *A self-sustaining cognitive ecosystem that reasons with NARS rigor, learns with LLM flexibility, perceives across multiple modalities, and evolves safely through resource-aware self-reflection, all governed by a core constitution.*

----

# GUI
- Enable anyone to use the system through a TODO-list paradigm.  In other words, knowing how to write and update a TODO list is essentially the only prerequisite to take advantage of the entire system - all functionality can be grounded in, and revised by, a line or section of an easily editable TODO list.  Following progressive disclosure principles, the grounding can contextualize UI construction
- UI Demo viewer: runs demos, in an isolated context and display, allowing all the steps to be inspected.
- Ontologies
   - SUMO - easily loadable and usable for common-sense reasoning
   - Personal / health / maintenance - immediately usable for PIM
- Export/import system state, with conf/pri filter
- Generate LM training data, to (re-)train LM models / LoRA adapters

# Testing
- Demos, from a variety of real-world application domains.  Function as unit tests and as demonstrable models, useful for education and development/testing purposes.
- NARS Demos: illustrate classic NARS reasoning, its compatibility and synergy with LM text.  Use a versatile set of interesting domains, showing the diverse applicability and necessity of the system.
- UI: generate a 'report' of rendering UI widgets (with dummy data), as one complete image that can be visually inspected

----

Refine Safety and Validation: Detail the violates function (e.g., use NARS deduction + LLM semantic similarity). Add simulation modes for testing self-modifications before rollout.
Enhance GUI Integration: Specify mappings, e.g., a TODO item as a GOAL UCE with editable attention values. For progressive disclosure, define UI layers (basic TODO â†’ advanced schema inspector).
Bolster Testing: Define success criteria for demos (e.g., accuracy thresholds for NARS reasoning). Add integration tests for full cycles (ingest â†’ reason â†’ act â†’ reflect).
Optimize for Scalability: Introduce sharding for the World Model or federated learning for estimators across instances.
Prototype Pathways: Start with a minimal viable implementation (e.g., text-only streams, simple NARS rules without LLMs) to validate core loops, then layer in multi-modality and self-reflection.

### Additional Constructive Criticism on the SeNARS Specification

Building on the initial evaluation, here are further areas of constructive criticism. These focus on deeper technical, usability, and strategic aspects that could enhance the architecture's robustness, practicality, and long-term viability. Each point includes specific suggestions for improvement to make the feedback actionable.

#### 1. **Limited Handling of Temporal and Causal Reasoning**
   - **Criticism**: The World Model includes a causal DAG and temporal B-tree index, which is a good start, but the spec lacks explicit mechanisms for handling dynamic, time-series data or probabilistic causal inference beyond basic links. For instance, the `trigger_local_resonance_check` focuses on semantic coherence but doesn't account for temporal decay of truth values (e.g., outdated beliefs) or counterfactual reasoning, which is crucial in evolving environments. This could lead to stale knowledge in fast-changing domains like real-time perception or decision-making under uncertainty.
   - **Suggestions**: Introduce temporal decay functions in UCE's `evolve` method (e.g., exponentially reduce confidence over time unless reinforced). Enhance the causal DAG with Bayesian network integration for probabilistic inference, using libraries like pgmpy (if code execution is available in prototypes). Add workflow steps in the Cognitive Core for periodic causal chain validation, triggered by high-priority goals.

#### 2. **Underdeveloped Multi-Modal Fusion**
   - **Criticism**: While I/O subsystems support multi-modal streams (e.g., TextStream, ImageStream), fusion across modalities is implicit and underdeveloped. For example, grounding an image detection (Tensor content) with textual beliefs isn't detailedâ€”how does a vision UCE link to a causal chain from text? This could result in siloed knowledge, reducing the system's ability to perform cross-modal reasoning (e.g., interpreting an image based on prior textual context).
   - **Suggestions**: Define explicit fusion operators in the SchemaRegistry, such as schemas for embedding alignment (e.g., using CLIP-like models for text-image similarity). In the `add` method of World Model, automatically compute cross-modal links via embedding distances. Prototype this with a demo where a visual input triggers textual inference, ensuring the GUI's TODO-list can query fused results (e.g., "Describe this image in context of my health ontology").

#### 3. **Potential Over-Reliance on Asynchronous Tasks**
   - **Criticism**: Features like `async_task_queue.submit` for resonance checks and background pruning are efficient for scalability but introduce non-determinism and potential inconsistencies (e.g., a UCE might be queried before its coherence boost applies). In resource-constrained scenarios, queue overflows could delay critical maintenance, affecting overall system coherence.
   - **Suggestions**: Implement priority-based async queues tied to UCE attention values, ensuring high-attention items process synchronously if needed. Add monitoring in the self-reflective loop to track async completion rates, with thresholds triggering synchronous fallbacks. For testing, include stress demos simulating high-load scenarios to validate queue behavior.

#### 4. **Incomplete Integration of Ontologies and Export/Import**
   - **Criticism**: Ontologies like SUMO are mentioned as "easily loadable," but the spec doesn't specify how they're ingested into the World Model (e.g., as pre-populated UCEs with high initial truth values) or how conflicts with experience-grounded beliefs are resolved. Similarly, export/import with conf/pri filters is useful but lacks details on format (e.g., serialized hypergraph subsets) or security (e.g., encrypting sensitive UCEs). This could hinder interoperability and data portability, especially for PIM applications.
   - **Suggestions**: Outline an ontology loader in DomainAdapters that maps ontology terms to UCEs, using NARS revision to merge with existing beliefs (e.g., boosting confidence if coherent). For export/import, standardize a JSON-LD format for UCE graphs, with filters as query parameters in the Unified Interface. Add privacy controls, like anonymizing personal data in exports, and test with round-trip demos (export state, import to new instance, verify consistency).

#### 5. **Schema Learning and Code Generation Risks**
   - **Criticism**: The schema learning process relies on LLM-generated code, which is sandboxed and tested, but the spec doesn't address LLM-specific issues like prompt sensitivity or generated code bloat. For example, if the LLM produces inefficient code (e.g., O(n^2) loops), it could degrade performance despite resource estimates. Trial mode is a safeguard, but without metrics for "success_rate" calibration, underperforming schemas might persist.
   - **Suggestions**: Incorporate prompt engineering guidelines in `schema_learning` (e.g., few-shot examples for efficient code). Add runtime profiling in schema execution to feed back into success_rate (e.g., penalize high-cost schemas). Extend unit testing to include performance benchmarks, and in the self-reflective loop, prune low-utility schemas automatically. For LM training data generation, use successful schemas as positive examples to fine-tune adapters.

#### 6. **GUI and User Interaction Shortcomings**
   - **Criticism**: The TODO-list paradigm is accessible, but it risks oversimplifying complex interactionsâ€”e.g., how does a user debug a failed workflow or inspect UCE conflicts via a list? Progressive disclosure is mentioned, but without examples, it might lead to hidden functionality, frustrating advanced users. The UI demo viewer is isolated, but lacks integration with real-time events, limiting educational value.
   - **Suggestions**: Map TODO items hierarchically (e.g., top-level goals expand to sub-UCEs/workflows), with editable fields for attention/priority. Implement contextual tooltips or chat-like queries grounded in the list for progressive disclosure. Enhance the demo viewer to support pausing/resuming with inspection overlays, and generate reports not just as images but interactive HTML for deeper analysis.

#### 7. **Testing and Validation Gaps**
   - **Criticism**: Demos are positioned as unit tests and educational tools, but the spec doesn't cover adversarial testing (e.g., injecting conflicting UCEs to test resilience) or coverage metrics (e.g., schema execution paths). NARS demos focus on synergy with LLMs, but without quantitative benchmarks (e.g., inference accuracy vs. pure NARS), it's hard to validate improvements.
   - **Suggestions**: Expand testing to include fuzzing workflows for UCE inputs and red-team scenarios for self-modification (e.g., attempting constitution-violating changes). Define KPIs like coherence score over time or goal completion rate. For NARS demos, compare against baselines (e.g., OpenNARS implementations) in diverse domains, and use the code execution tool in prototypes to automate benchmark runs.

#### 8. **Strategic and Deployment Considerations**
   - **Criticism**: The spec is domain-agnostic via adapters, but lacks guidance on deployment scaling (e.g., distributed instances sharing World Models) or ethical alignment beyond the constitution (e.g., bias mitigation in LLM augmentations). As of 2025, with advancing AGI regs, this could pose compliance risks.
   - **Suggestions**: Add federation protocols in the Unified Interface for multi-instance syncing (e.g., via secure WebSockets). Incorporate ethical audits in the self-reflective loop, scanning for biases in UCE clusters. For deployment, provide containerized prototypes (e.g., Docker configs) and align the constitution with standards like EU AI Act, testing via simulated regulatory scenarios.

These criticisms aim to refine SeNARS into a more mature, deployable system. Addressing them could involve iterative prototyping, starting with core loops and expanding to peripherals like GUI and ontologies. Overall, the spec remains innovative, and these enhancements would amplify its strengths in grounded, evolving cognition.
